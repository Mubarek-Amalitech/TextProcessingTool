# Project Objectives

- Gain proficiency in constructing and using regular expressions (regex) to search, match, and replace text patterns.
- Understand the fundamentals of Java collections (e.g., ArrayList, Set, Map) and their usages.
- Develop skills in creating user interfaces using JavaFX for interaction with the text processing tool.
- Develop proficiency in implementing complex software projects by applying advanced programming concepts.

# Description

A text processing and data management tool that allows users to perform various operations on text data using regular expressions and manipulate collections of data using Java collections.

# Features

## Regular Expressions (Regex) Module

- Implement functionality to search, match, and replace text using regular expressions.
- Support for sets, ranges, alternations, short hands, and quantifiers in regex patterns.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting regex patterns and text data.

## Text Processing Module

- Implement methods to search for patterns and replace characters in text data using regex.
- Utilize Java's `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes for regex operations.
- Display match results and replaced text to the user.

## Data Management Module

- Utilize Java collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `Set`, `Map`) for managing collections of data.
- Allow users to create, update, and delete entries in collections.
- Implement `hashCode` and `equals` methods for custom data objects to ensure proper collection operations.

## User Interface

- Develop a user interface using JavaFX for interacting with the tool.
- Provide options for inputting text data, regex patterns, and performing operations.
- Display results of regex operations and collection manipulations to the user.
